# promute
Promute is a Chrome Extension that automatically mutes twitter accounts sending promotions to your timeline as you scroll by.

It does the simplest thing that could possibly work.
Within a scroll listener, it ...
* ... identifies promoted tweets by the 'Promoted' label at the bottom,
* ... opens the tweets context menu,
* ... and clicks the mute button
