Promute is a browser addon that automatically mutes twitter accounts sending promotions to your timeline as you scroll by.

It's not very special, but scratches my personal itch and I can't mislay it now that it's published for Chrome and FF.

It does the simplest thing that could possibly work.
Within a scroll listener, it ...
* ... identifies promoted tweets by the 'Ad' label beside the menu activator,
* ... opens the tweets context menu,
* ... and clicks the mute button

In personal timelines, it hides promoted tweets as muting there does _not_ remove the tweet in question.

You can review the muted accounts as usual in your twitter settings: https://twitter.com/settings/muted/all
