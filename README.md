# promute
Promute is a browser addon that automatically mutes twitter accounts sending promotions to your timeline as you scroll by.

It does the simplest thing that could possibly work.
Within a scroll listener, it ...
* ... identifies promoted tweets by the 'Promoted' label at the bottom,
* ... opens the tweets context menu,
* ... and clicks the mute button

You can review the muted accounts as usual in your twitter settings: https://twitter.com/settings/muted/all

## Requirements

Promute is known to work with current versions of Firefox (v72) and Chrome (v87). Other browsers have not been tested.

## Installation
